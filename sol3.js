//Given a program statement console.log(2 ^ 4);, check the output and explain why it is that way.

console.log(2 ^ 4);

// Explanation:
// the output is 6 because bitwise xor operation is being performed here and not the exponent operation.
// 2 in binary is 10 and 4 is 100, their bitwise xor gives 110 i.e. 6.
